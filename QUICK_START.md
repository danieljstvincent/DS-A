# Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Your First Week: Arrays & Strings

### Day 1: System Mastery
1. Read `tiers/tier-1-core-systems/01-system-mastery-guides/arrays-strings/`
   - Start with `complexity-cheatsheet.md`
   - Review `implementation-variations.md`
   - Study `when-to-use.md`

2. Practice Implementation
   - Implement reverse array (O(1) space)
   - Implement two pointers template
   - Implement sliding window template

### Day 2-3: Foundation Problems
1. Solve problems from `tiers/tier-1-core-systems/02-foundation-problems/arrays-must-solve.md`
   - Start with: Two Sum, Contains Duplicate, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
   - Document solutions in `solutions/tier-1/arrays-strings/`

2. For each problem:
   - Understand the problem
   - Identify optimal approach
   - Implement solution
   - Analyze time/space complexity

### Day 4-5: Hashing
1. Read `tiers/tier-1-core-systems/01-system-mastery-guides/hashing/`
2. Solve problems from `tiers/tier-1-core-systems/02-foundation-problems/hashing-must-solve.md`
3. Document solutions in `solutions/tier-1/hashing/`

### Day 6-7: Review & Practice
1. Review all problems solved this week
2. Update `practice/mastery-checklist.md`
3. Quiz yourself on complexities
4. Re-implement solutions from scratch

## 📋 Daily Study Template

### Morning (60 min): System Mastery
- Review system mastery guide
- Re-implement 3 core operations from scratch
- Create/update flashcards for complexities

### Afternoon (90 min): Foundation Problems
- Solve 2-3 problems from foundation problems list
- Apply the Trifecta approach:
  1. Understand problem and constraints
  2. Identify optimal approach
  3. Implement and test
- Document insights in problem notes

### Evening (30 min): Spaced Repetition
- Quiz yourself on 2 previous systems
- Update mastery checklist
- Review complexity cheatsheets

## ✅ Weekly Checklist

- [ ] Completed system mastery guide review
- [ ] Solved 10-15 foundation problems
- [ ] Can implement core operations from scratch
- [ ] Updated mastery checklist
- [ ] Reviewed previous week's material

## 🎓 Progression Path

### Week 1-2: Arrays, Strings, Hashing
- Focus: Basic operations, two pointers, hashing patterns
- Goal: Master O(n) array operations and hash map usage

### Week 3: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- Focus: List operations, stack/queue patterns
- Goal: Understand when to use each structure

### Week 4: Trees
- Focus: Tree traversals, BST operations
- Goal: Master DFS and BFS on trees

### Week 5: Graphs
- Focus: Graph representations, BFS/DFS
- Goal: Understand graph traversal algorithms

### Week 6: Heaps, Searching, Sorting, Recursion, Basic DP
- Focus: Advanced data structures and algorithms
- Goal: Complete Tier 1 foundation

## 🚨 Important Reminders

1. **Don't skip ahead**: Master Tier 1 before Tier 2
2. **Depth over breadth**: Better to master 10 systems than solve 500 random problems
3. **Understand why**: Don't just memorize solutions
4. **Track progress**: Update mastery checklist regularly

## 📚 Key Files to Reference

- **Main README**: `README.md` - Overview of tier system
- **Tier 1 Guide**: `tiers/tier-1-core-systems/README.md`
- **Exit Exam**: `practice/tier-1-exit-exam.md`
- **Mastery Checklist**: `practice/mastery-checklist.md`

## 🎯 Success Metrics

You're ready to move to Tier 2 when:
- ✅ Score ≥90% on Tier 1 Exit Exam
- ✅ Can identify which system to use for any Tier 1 problem
- ✅ Can recite complexities from memory
- ✅ Can implement basic data structures in <10 minutes

---

**Remember**: The goal is mastery, not speed. Take your time with Tier 1 - it's the foundation for everything else!
