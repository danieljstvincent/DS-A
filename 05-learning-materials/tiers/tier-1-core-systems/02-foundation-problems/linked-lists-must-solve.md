# Linked Lists: Must-Solve Foundation Problems

**Goal**: Master singly and doubly linked lists, common patterns.

## Essential Problems (10-15)

### Basic Operations
- [ ] **Reverse Linked List** (LeetCode 206)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Iterative or recursive
  - Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space iterative

- [ ] **Merge Two Sorted Lists** (LeetCode 21)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Two pointers merge
  - Complexity: O(n + m) time, O(1) space

- [ ] **Remove Duplicates from Sorted List** (LeetCode 83)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Single pass
  - Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space

### Two Pointers on Lists
- [ ] **Linked List Cycle** (LeetCode 141)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Floyd's algorithm (fast/slow)
  - Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space

- [ ] **Middle of the Linked List** (LeetCode 876)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Fast/slow pointers
  - Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space

- [ ] **Remove Nth Node From End** (LeetCode 19)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Two pointers with offset
  - Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space

### Advanced
- [ ] **Add Two Numbers** (LeetCode 2)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Digit-by-digit addition
  - Complexity: O(max(n, m)) time, O(1) space

- [ ] **Intersection of Two Linked Lists** (LeetCode 160)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Two pointers technique
  - Complexity: O(n + m) time, O(1) space

- [ ] **Copy List with Random Pointer** (LeetCode 138)
  - System: Linked Lists
  - Pattern: Hash map or interleaving
  - Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) or O(1) space

## Key Concepts to Master

1. **Dummy Node Pattern**
   - Use when head might change
   - Simplifies edge cases

2. **Fast & Slow Pointers**
   - Cycle detection
   - Finding middle
   - Finding kth from end

3. **When to Use Linked List vs Array**
   - Linked List: Frequent insertions/deletions
   - Array: Random access needed

## Mastery Checklist

- [ ] Can implement singly linked list from scratch
- [ ] Can reverse list iteratively and recursively
- [ ] Can detect cycle using Floyd's algorithm
- [ ] Understand when to use dummy node
- [ ] Can merge two sorted lists efficiently
