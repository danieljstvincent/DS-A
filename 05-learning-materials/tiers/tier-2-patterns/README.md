# Tier 2: Problem-Solving Patterns & Techniques

## Overview

Tier 2 focuses on **recurring meta-patterns** that combine Tier 1 systems to solve more complex problems. You should only begin Tier 2 after achieving ≥90% on the Tier 1 Exit Exam.

## Philosophy: Pattern Recognition

Each pattern is typically tied to specific Tier 1 systems. The goal is to recognize which pattern applies to which problem type.

## Prerequisites

Before starting Tier 2, you must be able to:

- ✅ Look at any Tier 1 problem and immediately identify which system to use
- ✅ Recite complexities of all common operations for each system
- ✅ Implement any basic data structure in <10 minutes

## Core Patterns

1. **Two Pointers** → Arrays/Lists
2. **Sliding Window** → Arrays/Strings + Hashing
3. **Fast & Slow Pointers** → Linked Lists
4. **Merge Intervals** → Arrays + Sorting
5. **Cyclic Sort** → Arrays
6. **Topological Sort** → Graphs with dependencies
7. **Backtracking** → Recursion + State management
8. **Greedy** → Multiple systems
9. **Advanced DP Patterns** → Dynamic Programming
10. **Bit Manipulation** → Numbers/Arrays
11. **Union-Find** → Graphs

## Pattern-System Mapping

See `01-pattern-mastery/pattern-system-matrix.md` for detailed mapping of which patterns use which Tier 1 systems.

## Study Approach

### For Each Pattern:

1. **Understand the Pattern** (30 min)
   - Read pattern mastery guide
   - Understand when to apply it
   - Learn the template/approach

2. **Practice Problems** (90 min)
   - Solve 5-10 problems using this pattern
   - Focus on recognizing when to use it
   - Document variations and edge cases

3. **Review & Connect** (30 min)
   - Connect pattern to Tier 1 systems
   - Review similar patterns
   - Update pattern recognition skills

## Common Mistake

❌ **Don't**: Memorize pattern templates without understanding the underlying Tier 1 systems

✅ **Do**: Understand which Tier 1 systems each pattern combines and why

## Study Timeline

- **Week 1**: Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Fast & Slow Pointers
- **Week 2**: Merge Intervals, Cyclic Sort, Topological Sort
- **Week 3**: Backtracking, Greedy
- **Week 4**: Advanced DP, Bit Manipulation, Union-Find
