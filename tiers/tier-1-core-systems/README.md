# Tier 1: Core Computer Science Systems

## Overview

Tier 1 is the **critical foundation** that forms the building blocks of 80-90% of coding interview questions. You **MUST** master each system sequentially before moving to Tier 2.

## Philosophy: Depth Over Breadth

Don't just solve problems. For each system, you must internalize:

- ✅ Exact time/space complexities of all operations
- ✅ Implementation details and trade-offs
- ✅ When to use it vs. alternatives
- ✅ Common patterns and variations

## Core Systems (Master in Order)

1. **Arrays & Strings** - Week 1-2
2. **Hashing** - Week 1-2
3. **Linked Lists** - Week 3
4. **Stacks & Queues** - Week 3
5. **Trees** - Week 4
6. **Graphs** - Week 5
7. **Heaps** - Week 6
8. **Searching** - Week 6
9. **Sorting** - Week 6
10. **Recursion** - Week 6
11. **Basic Dynamic Programming** - Week 6

## Study Approach for Each System

### Phase 1: System Mastery (60 min/day)
- Review `01-system-mastery-guides/[system]/` materials
- Re-implement 3 core operations from scratch
- Create/update flashcards for complexities
- Study implementation variations and trade-offs

### Phase 2: Foundation Problems (90 min/day)
- Solve problems from `02-foundation-problems/[system]-must-solve.md`
- Apply the Trifecta approach to each problem
- Document insights in problem notes
- Focus on 10-15 MUST-SOLVE problems per system

### Phase 3: Spaced Repetition (30 min/day)
- Quiz yourself on 2 previous systems
- Update mastery checklist
- Review complexity cheatsheets

## Why Tier 1 First?

1. **Maximum ROI**: Most interview questions are Tier 1 or Tier 2
2. **Builds Intuition**: Deep understanding lets you derive solutions
3. **Prevents Cargo Cult**: Understand why, not just how
4. **Efficiency**: Master 10 systems deeply > 500 problems superficially

## Exit Criteria for Tier 1

Before moving to Tier 2, you must:

- ✅ Look at any Tier 1 problem and immediately identify which system to use
- ✅ Recite complexities of all common operations for each system
- ✅ Implement any basic data structure in <10 minutes
- ✅ Score ≥90% on the Tier 1 Exit Exam

See `practice/tier-1-exit-exam.md` for the complete checklist.

## Common Mistake

❌ **Don't**: Jump into "Hard" problems because they seem impressive

✅ **Do**: Classify problems by their primary system. "Trapping Rain Water" is Tier 1 (Arrays) + Tier 2 (Two Pointers), not Tier 3.
