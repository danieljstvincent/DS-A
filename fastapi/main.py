Hello Alumni,

First and foremost, I want to say a big thank you to Jamie and Jessica (and anyone else I may have missed!) for organizing today’s meeting. Your efforts, including holding onto the $150 from our last reunion and even offering refunds for that event, truly show your dedication and heart in organizing this 20-year reunion. It’s inspiring and deeply appreciated.

I wanted to share a few thoughts for us to consider as we plan this event:

Ticket Sales:
To make things smoother, I propose we consider selling non-refundable tickets but provide an option for attendees to resell their tickets if needed. If a significant number of refunds are requested and we end up having to cancel a non-refundable venue, it could leave us in a tough spot financially. Of course, this is just an idea, and the final decision is up to the group.

Ticket Distribution:
From our meeting, it seems we’ll need funds early to plan the reunion. Many ticket platforms only release funds after the event, which could cause challenges. I came across RSVPify, which disperses funds every 48 business hours. While it costs $288 for a year, it might be worth it for the convenience and efficiency it offers in streamlining ticket sales. Something to consider!

T-Shirt Sales and Design:
For T-shirt distribution, I explored a platform called Printify and created a sample store for us to check out: Fairfield High Reunion Store.

I suggest we offer two ticket pricing options: one that includes a T-shirt and one that doesn’t. We can issue a unique code for T-shirt orders, making them free for those who purchase the bundle, while still allowing others to buy additional merchandise if they’d like.

Take a look at the two design styles and let me know which one you prefer:

Style 1
Style 2
I’m excited about the potential of this reunion and all the ideas we’re bringing together. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
